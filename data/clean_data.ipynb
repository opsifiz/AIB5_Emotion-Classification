We are investigating the impact of borderline personality disorder (BPD) on sexual risk-taking behaviour. You can take part if you have or have received in the past a diagnosis of BPD, and if you do not have (or never received in the past) a diagnosis of BPD. There will be six questionnaires to complete, as well as a couple of open-ended questions. The questions will be covering sensitive issues, including symptoms of BPD, sexual behaviour and being a victim of trauma (such as a crime, physical and/or sexual abuse). Please do not take part if you will be affected by any of the topics covered. All responses will be completely anonymous. It should take around 30 minutes. The study has received ethical approval (2021\\\\_6465). This research is important as it will highlight key areas that need to be focused on in treatment programmes for BPD. Treatment may then be able to reduce sexual risk-taking behaviour, which may potentially prevent individuals becoming a victim of future trauma, such as sexual abuse. \\n\\nPlease click the link below for further information and to take part in the study. \\n\\n[https://unioflincoln.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\\\_enQqf3JUhMUhbj8](https://unioflincoln.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_enQqf3JUhMUhbj8)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"status\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"bipolar\",\n          \"Normal\",\n          \"Personality disorder\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"from\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"df1\",\n          \"df2\",\n          \"df3\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3309,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"good morning everyone\",\n          \"so first if you have literally anything better to do with your time do not bother reading this because i doubt anything can change my thoughts and situation after alot of thought and just imagining different progressions in my life i realized that there are only beings in the world that i care about my parents and our dog and i feel like i know that once those are gone i will just find a quiet and nondisruptive way to end it that will not give anyone that finds me trauma i see no reason to be alive and frankly do not want to be alive now but i refuse to hurt my parents that much by committing suicide while they are around so i do not need a suicide watch or anything odds are suicide will be a few decades in the future bit of backstory as to how i ended up where i am i am currently around m and about to finish m in a caribbean medical school when i graduated undergrad i had a decent number of friends i cared about and i think i was pretty normal but due to a variety of reasons some of my own making and some beyond my control i was not able to get into medical school right out of college and as the months went on i was too embarrassed to stay in contact with friends i had known for over a decade because they were going somewhere in life and i had done nothing and felt worthless so i basically ghosted everyone i know then the pandemic hit and i was at home with my parents and our new puppy i eventually lowered my standards and applied to caribbean medical schools and got into one and ended up living at home and doing online classes for a year and a half due to pandemic i have always been close to my parents and them me and that did not change now fast forward to recently and i have been inperson for classes and tried to socialize somewhat and try to become more normal but i realized that while i am not some antisocial recluse i have yet to meet or talk to any person that i built any kind of relationship with even the people that i think consider me their friend to me they exist in the category of very distant acquaintances and i feel no desire for that to change nor do i see any way for that to change i think my life trajectory is i will finish school hopefully get a decent residency and keep my parents company into their older age basically i have realized i cannot make any new connections and do not want any that could make me feel bad about my plans that once my parents and our dog are all gone i will end up killing myself i do not feel reluctant about this trajectory i do not really even want to change it i look forward to that day because it means it will all be over but i also dread that day because it means the only living beings in the world that i care about and who care about me will be gone i think this is just what my fate was meant to be\",\n          \"do i have bpd\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

However, I still suspect, intuitively, that there are some people whose depression (or other mental illness) falls much more toward the genetic/nuerochemical side of the spectrum and  visa versa. \\n\\nI would situate myself closer to the second camp. I was extremely sensitive and high strung, even as a baby, and that combined with my introversion, lively imagination, slow processing speed, pessimism, difficulty at school, lack of siblings or cousins, frequent moves as a child, chaotic and inconsistent upbringing, my natural tendency to think and feel (too) deeply and romanticize or exaggerate \\\"dark\\\" feelings, all predisposed me to a childhood of chronic social isolation, low self esteem, and eventually depression and anxiety. Multiple traumatic incidents and abuse beginning in adolescence didn\\u2019t help. Then struggling and dropping out of college lowered my self esteem a lot. \\n\\nI\\u2019m trying to climb my way out but I\\u2019m overwhelmed. The meds aren\\u2019t really working or I can\\u2019t tell if they are working since right now I have so many bad habits and a less than ideal living situation and while Ive done a lot to improve lifestyle there is so much more I could do.  \\n\\nI\\u2019m sure some of it is genetic. There is a lot of depression on my father's side of family, and my maternal grandmother has OCD and anxiety, my mother has OCD and ADHD and my uncle probably has Aspergers.\\n\\nHow do I even know if I should bother with finding the right meds? Is there a completely different treatment for different kinds of depression?

with google translate there are many issues but the main issue right now is how often i get overwhelmed it has been around since the beginning and has gotten much worse during puberty what i mean by conquest is every once in a while something comes into my life that my brain is literally locked into that thing becomes my whole life i think about it every moment thoughts accompanied by torment and burst and mad and very obsessive i research it for hours and i can not sleep at night it literally becomes the first priority of my life so i do not do the very important things i have to do because i can not they are no longer important anxiety drives me crazy it is so painful every moment is enough to destroy me and i really have no control and logic does not work the times when it gets so intense explode my brain it is as if i am getting closer to death every moment and it attacks me so much that i am in a predicament and i can only cry and shout silently and then i calm down a little but it still goes on and on i know there is something wrong with this job during this conquest i know this is not normal i can not get rid of everything i do meditation not thinking about it facing it praying are of no use no matter how much i run away from it it finally catches me and sinks into my heart like a dagger i can not deal with it i can not deal with it i can not wait for it to end no one cares and only my time is wasted i have been like this for many years this is the depth of the story but its appearance changes every time some time ago when i went to the doctor he said that this type of bipolar disorder was accompanied by obsessivecompulsive disorder and that his medications were depakine haldol clomipramine and asentra these were good but they killed me like a robot and now i really need to study and i cannot with them i know i am obsessed but i have not seen anywhere that the symptoms are like this in fact i have struggled a lot with obsession and i know it well but it is different on the other hand i can not say that this is mania because i really do not have much energy at all times almost always this wave starts and stays with a lot of energy but many times i do not have much energy and it just attacks me there is also depression there is no solution in my mind and no idea exactly where the problem is here are some examples the first time it was so severe i thought my ears were weak i thought about my weak ears every day it did not matter to me at all but it suddenly became important even though i was young i would go out and go to the doctor under various pretexts they said it was not a problem but i was just suffering i thought i was losing my ears it lasted about a month or two and then disappeared the following cases were also medical and more severe with anxiety and crazy thinking until it reappeared in a new way i who was not good at any course suddenly decided to change my major and be able to take an important scholarship exam after a high grade i can not say how much i believed in myself i thought i would always be like this i talked to people i was online all day and getting information i did not sleep at night and could not eat its suffering and anxiety were insane i was not at ease in any of those moments but my parents objected and i felt much worse at these times and i saw myself at the end of the world after all i do not remember how but he disappeared and i had no idea why i was so stupid there were many cases for example once i was like this about my relationships with people when i woke up at in the morning until at night i was walking in my room and thinking like crazy i prepared behavioral principles for myself on paper i was sensitive to the behavior of others and analyzed the behavior of everyone during the day after that i became involved in the religion cycle several times a day i became religious and antigod when i was antigod i went to alcohol and porn after a while i felt insecure and afraid of dying right away at that time i became religious again and felt liberated and saved and i wanted to die for god and i hated my unbelieving friends but the next day i reached emptiness and had no understanding of god and became secular again and i thought theistic people were stupid for two years every day went on a painful cycle i could no longer trust myself i could trust my feelings i had lost my identity every day i experienced both the worst possible and the best possible i am still in it but i can not say anything about it there are many other issues but i will stop no one can help me doctors family friends all my life is wasted next month i have a test that is very important but i have not read anything for the third year my father will kill me because he has spent so much i am ashamed and i would like to die nothing lasts there is no lasting solution no light is stable i swear to god that i can find nothing in my life that will last everyone who

only would i do the obnoxious and hurtful actions you would expect of a self absorbed crock of shit but i also remember harassing actively developing artists for my own enjoyment and in the end i get

significance or future for myself in the area i wish for is something i regret sincerely the concept i am anything but an insufferable and revolting train wreck of a human being who never should have tainted the notion of artistic endeavor is something i never will not feel guilty about manipulating people into not believing and the few times i would attempt something scrambling to figure out what

pierce through the barriers that perpetually imprison me is being incredibly merciful to the likes of myself and it is a shame and inherently a crime that it is not worse it genuinely repulses me to think i am considered part of the same species as people such as einstein van gogh and mozart i have spent so long hating the world only for it all to finally turn around once i figured it all out the truth is i am an unending disgrace to the only things i have ever looked up to and my only dreams i deserve all of the agony i receive be it physical mental or spiritual and i deserve to die for my actions any situation where i feel i am not receiving adequate punishment i will bang my head on the wall i will beat my stomach with my baton and once i have the strength within i will exit life my existence has been a stain on this earth figuratively and literally an accident no one deserved to endure my bullying and toxicity nor my sobbing and whining for it biting me in the ass the concept of art never deserved my abhorrent faade of being capable of bearing it with my own hands nor my pitiful reaches of desperation for the idea i ever would have equated to the greatness i witness in those i envy to think of myself being the one to advance and execute my ideas and gain significance and skill after the things i have done it is an insult not just to art as a concept but the human race altogether now that i think about it it is good that my suicide attempt in was not successful i needed to suffer more to account for my crimes i never should have been a concept and i wish nothing but the worst for myself when i extinguish from existence by my own hands',\n",

i often used psychological tactics to people who loved meor inflicting mild harm on purpose to them i knew how to get what i wanted when i wanted how i wanted when i turned around four i moved in with my grandparents and i lived with them for around a year because my mom was attending college my mother gave birth to me when she was relatively young and my mother and my father seperated not too long after i was born he abused her from what she is told me after my mother graduated from college she decided to stop with education and raise me instead she met a guy while she was there his name we will say was tim years later i have started to make a liking for him soon later my mother and tim decided to get married i remember after the marriage tim started being abusive to me when my mother was not home he would nearly suffocate me with his hands for screaming in hopes somebody would hear me when nobody was home i was four a year or so later my mother decided to divorce him because i started acting differently then in hopes i would stop acting how i did she sent me to child therapy some part of me knew that my therapist and mother were trying to pry me open for something so important but i would not budge i did not want my mother to feel sad for me my grandmother and my mothers father used to abuse my mother her father was a drug addict and always got into trouble they have both been shot at in a car once my grandmother was crazystupid for him she could never leave him no matter how bad it was for her and her children my uncle used to get beat up by his own father my mother has picked up on these negative parenting behaviors and carried them out to me she has also always been emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive towards me throughout my childhood she always screamed at me for doing something wrong she is beat the shit out of me with slippers and a hanger before she used to ask me sometimes if i have ever touched somebody inappropriately of course my answer was always no etc then around a year after the divorce my mother started seeing another guy we will say his name is arthur arthur had a son longstoryshort he used to sexually harass me then they decided to get married so the sexual harassment for me continued all the way until i was six to about nine arthur himself is not a great guy he is bipolar and he cannot control his urges in times like these i became a sadist i enjoyed hurting animals and insects i loved mutilating insects torturing them finding new unique ways each kill i spent most of my week doing this when i was around ten i have had a friend that is also sexually harassed me once when we were all alone in these snowy woods i let him do it to me because he said he would not lead me the way out if i rejected it so i let him he was three years older than me i never talked to him after that when i was around eleven or twelve me and my friend killed an armadillo when we were hunting for birds with a bb gun we chased it into a ditch and i stabbed it do death for him there was a lot of blood i had a massive adrenaline rush i was enjoying it i knew what i was doing was morally wrong but it is never really haunted me i do not really regret it at all however when i was around fifteen i started to develop severe depression it started coming to me because i myself was turning into an atheist i used to be christian no only that but i was accepting myself for who i was and i did not want to i did not want to be gay and i feel as if my trauma might have made me gay also homocidal thoughts have started to cross my mind and i have had many situations in which i wanted to kill someone or a group of people somehow i was sent to therapy again i have never opened up about my homocidal thoughts one day i tried to commit suicide by cutting but i failed miserably and was sent to a psychiatric ward for ten consecutive days so basically i have always lived with this trauma even now i still have never opened up about it my mother and arthur have no idea about what is been going on in my life sometimes my mother will say to me you do not have any good reason to be depressed you have never had a horrible childhood like me and your grandmother now i am seventeen i am not nearly as depressed as i used to be i still do have homocidal thoughts occasionally and my sadism has never really left me i have very intense anger issues in which i will stab stuff in my room with a knife to relieve myself but nonetheless i am not depressed now that i am older i am starting to believe that i might become a psychopath or sociopath because my behaviors have not ever left me i have done a good amount of research on both of these personality disorders along with others it is the closest thing i can find about me i have looked into quite a few mental illnesses and other personality disorders too nothing seems to fit as well as aspd i do not ever usually show any signs of stress remorse guilt and

              " 'this is going to be a long post please stay with me i will start with i am bipolar with psychosis i am not ignorant to mental illness i know it is sometimes out of our control i have not had an episode in over years now i am on meds and my mental health has been doing amazing i have a best friend we have been best friends for years now i love her dearly i have been basically adopted by her family at this point i am extremely close with her parents and siblings long story short we tried dating but it did not work out she moved to a different state and long distance was too hard to do mostly though we decided we were better as friends we are closer from the experience in a completely platonic way i love her and always will but as a friend she has brothers and sister she also has a sisterinlaw i am extremely close to the sisterinlaw as well we are all good friends the post is going to be about the sisterinlaw who i will call sil because it is quicker to type she is also bipolar i am not sure if she has psychosis as well she is told me yes and no when i have asked different times in the past sil is married to the oldest brother and i am dating the youngest brother i will call him ybrother for the post sil knows me and my bf best friend tried dating me and my bf decided not to tell many people her parents know sil knows and her husband obrother we are not trying to hide anything we mainly just do not talk about it it was years ago and in our past i have been going through some extremely difficult times the past two months in june i figured out i was raped as a child and locked memories came forward sil was there to comfort me i told her i was okay but she insisted on driving to me and giving me a hug we ended up talking about things for about hours when we were talking i mentioned how it broke my heart when bf moved away but i would love her always meaning in a platonic way i would love her no matter what our friendship has gone through a lot and we are closer than ever i did not think twice about my comment because i really did mean it innocently i honestly thought she knew what i meant fast forward a couple weeks to july and i find out given explicit details that my young niece was raped it was extremely triggering for me and i started to cry i happened to be at sil house at the time i went to her crying and really upset she said and i quote there is nothing i can do for you you need to let the emotions run their course go get a weighted blanket i was stoned when she told me this i sobered up and left at am i have been upset with her since but still been very nice i never mentioned being upset and we hung out a couple times after that now we are going to get to the problem a few nights ago sil called my bf sil told my bf that she is upset with me because ybrother has canceled hanging out with her and obrother times now because of me that i am hogging him she also said i am too high maintenance of a friend and i am being clingy and needy to her the biggest issue i had was she said she did not feel comfortable with the love triangle i created with bf and ybrother she said i am using ybrother and i do not actually like him and i am still in love with bf she said it is not fair to ybrother and she was going to tell him that me and bf dated which honestly all that took me by surprise i went through texts and phone calls and our communication has been minimal it is also been equal for incoming and outgoing calls to each other i have not been overly calling and texting her as she claims it also upset me for her to say i am hogging ybrother he is a grown man and makes his own choices she invited him to hangout this past sunday he invited me because we always do group hangouts and he wanted to include me she is told me on multiple occasions i am welcome whenever neither of us thought twice about the invite when i mentioned coming over she said she did not want me to come over and was not up to entertaining when ybrother messaged asking me what time i was going to head over i said what sil told me he responded oh that is weird i probably will not go over if she is not up to entertaining there were a couple other times i guess he canceled on her that i was not aware of the biggest issue i had was her saying she was going to tell ybrother about me and bf it felt like a threat and she is trying to sabotage me in a way when me and bf were discussing everything we both remembered sil has admitted to having a crush on ybrother in the past she claimed it was only a little one and it did not mean anything both of us at the time that it was told to us thought it was a little odd but never thought too much about it after i decided i would tell ybrother that me and bf tried dating i also decided that i needed to take major step back from sil something is extremely wrong with her perceptive of me and she is starting to create delusions about me honestly i think what is going on is postpartum depressionpsychosis she had a baby in march and i think she is experiencing some type of psychosis and paranoia triggered by a manic episode she is been off her meds for over two years as well and was refusing to go back on them i am also wondering if the little crush she mentioned is not so little and she is becoming extremely jealous of me i am not sure how to proceed i am so hurt and surprised by all this yesterday sil did tell bf she was going to go to the doctor and go back on meds she also said she would wait till meds have kicked in before discussing everything with me even if she does go on meds and goes back to her normal self i do not think i want to be friends with her anymore her feelings are obviously deep rooted it seems to me she is been holding onto some type of resentment towards me and now it is all spilling out i am trying to be patient with everything but this all too much it is honestly scaring me a little too i am not sure if my fear is an overreaction though but she really has created delusions about me and is trying to get others in the family to take her side which everyone shuts her down right away because they do not want to get involved which i think is making it worse for her too i am not trying to put family in the middle and wanted unbiased outside perspective looking for advice on what my next steps should be with all this also wondering if i am overreacting being so upset and freaked out by her behavior',\n",
              " 'here is a thought i have been thinking about lately i used to always think that mental health has a very direct relation with your life situation if you do not have friends no job do not have hobbys do not have money do not have a partner have a poor family situation it is almost inevitable that you develop mental health disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or depression however recently i had a thought that that might not be quite the truth i think what could be the real problem leading to mental health disorders is that it is not such much your problematic life situation per se that causes the problems nor the fact that you are not making progress or are stuck in certain areas of your life it is that because you are not making progress or feel stuck your thoughts are going in circles over your life situation or certain areas of your life where you are stuck i mean that you do not find anything other in life to focus your thoughts and behaviour on so that you inevitably come to analyse your own life situation leading to worry and anxietydepression and so it is not per se your life situation quality or the fact that you are stuck but rather your focus on being stuck that causes all the trouble for example if someone with a mental health disorder takes a long vacation that in itself could better his mental health not by virtue of improving his life situation but by effectively providing a means to focus their thoughts and behavior elsewhere as another example there are people with a decent life situation good financial situation kids good relationships but feel they are not making progress in life in a certain area and this being stuck becomes a major focus in their life and starts to absorb all their thinking it is like a sinkhole for thoughts that would drown anybody',\n",

              " 'my nd cousin megan who i rarely see last time i saw her was in was actually recently disowned by my entire family relatives and all for making hate accounts and attacking them out of the blue she is a fan of shawn mendes same with myself we both have fan accounts on instagram i recently made my fan account in december and found her account and decided to follow her she posts daily on her story all about the drama that she causes and blames on other people that goes wrong in her life i became good friends with two other fan accounts apparently my cousin has had a fan account for a while on various social media platforms and has a reputation as a bully she has targeted many fan accounts in the past for no reason since actually stealing their pictures and reposting them with mean captions making fake hate accounts pretending to be them pretends to be friends with other fan accounts friends to gain their trust and turns on them and uses that info against them blaming it on other people when caught sending death threats and threatening people just overall being really mean and nasty for no reason nobody has ever done anything to her we can all tell it is her because the wording and phrasing is very similar on all the accounts and somehow her own account is always being attacked by the hate accounts as well thankfully nobody knows she is related to me she has not turned on me yet but i am sure it is in the works she has also posted videos of her getting attention at shawns concerts which is rare for fans to get one on one attention she rubs it in peoples faces she also posts all these bullying quotes like you can tell when someone is truly miserable in their lives when they look for ways to destroy somebody elses lives nobody watches you harder than the people that hate you stuff like that nobody bullies her in fact if i look at all the accounts that follow me compared to her only other fan accounts follow her most of the fandom follows me her not so much i may have short of k followers but mine are genuine other fans i believe she buys her followers she recently has been attacking my one friend on a hate account calling her a superficial fake btch telling her to kll herself stealing her pics saying shawn hates her she is a worthless pos just a bunch of rude things my friend has been a victim of her bullying on another social media platform years ago she has not even posted since march on her instagram yet she is being attacked we have had most of the fandom report it to instagram yet it is still up i messaged her saying this before i say anything i would like to say this we are all fans of shawn mendes we are all here for one person nobodies account is better than the other we are all equal fan accounts the reason i am messaging you is because a bunch of fans are speculating that you are the one behind the recent hate accounts you have a paper trail that goes all the way back to with bullying on various platforms you make all these fake accounts and attack other fans for no reason stealing their pictures and reposting them with derogatory captions slandering their identities telling people to kll themselves and threatening them you have also made hate accounts for shawn mendes family members you have a history of befriending other fan accounts just to suddenly turn on them and use their information against them you also have a history of trying to blame it on other people when you get called out i can send you all the screenshots if you would like you are not innocent i find it very convenient how you were looking at your old ipad the other day and posting your old accounts to your story and now the bullying is starting up again you even had it set in your current bio to hatersyoucankys and now that is gone after you just told another fan to kll themselves to try and cover your tracks i also find it very funny how you post quotes from google images about bullying and claim that people bully you when in fact you are the bully your entire family disowned you for this very reason and now your attacking random people on the internet nobody in this fandom says two words to you because most people do not trust or like you in this fandom you pretty much have no legs to stand on drama seems to follow you online and in real life judging by your daily posts on your stories and it is you that creates it nobody knows what your problem is or why you attack people you have serious issues nobody ever did anything to you everybody was nice to you because they have no reason to be mean and you go off like a nut most people are not mean to others just to be mean you just attacked my friend on a fake account claiming she is fake and stealing her pictures and telling her to kll herself and that shawn hates her you know she has not posted since march and this is not her first rodeo with you completely out of the blue the wording and phrasing is similar on your account and all the hate accounts over the last years you are very undeserving of any attention you got at shawns concerts if he only knew how you treated other fans you would probably be banned from his concerts he does not condone bullying everybody can see right through you and your attention seeking ways are you proud of that this needs to stop it is getting old are not you tired yet what exactly are you trying to accomplish i am honestly not even sure why you have a fan account you are extremely pessimistic it is a shame because you are a very pretty girl but you have such a revolting personality you are seriously mentally disturbed and it is not cute or funny i am going to unfollow your account i would rather not be associated with people of your kind anymore good riddance seek help',\n",

issues that the docs cannot seem to figure out i am borderline manic depressive suffer severe anxiety have agoraphobia ptsd from being robbed at gun point while in college and being sodomized by a friends older brother when i was and suffer from daily panic attacks some of which are so bad i end up in the er i have not been with a woman romantically in about years and i am mentally incapable of leaving the house the final aspect being i still live with my entire family parents brother and sister when i was in high school i dated a girl throughout the entirety of it we had even made plans for what we would be doing together after school and had even made wedding plans near the end of our senior year not even two months after high school she drops this bombshell on me that she had fallen out of love with me two years prior and she did not have the strength to tell me this completely fucked up everything that i had planned and it also means i had wasted the last two years of high school dating someone who no longer had feelings for me meaning i could have been looking for someone new but that chance was stolen from me fast forward about a year later and i had found someone new this relationship ended up being a disaster from the start she had cheated on me multiple times but i was still in a bad place from my last relationship and desperately not wanting to be alone so my stupid ass kept forgiving her after about a year and her cheating for a third time i finally just ghosted her now i am in college shooting for a bachelors degree i am doing quite well in most of my classes not the top of my class by any means but i was getting solid grades one night i get a knock on my door of my apartment peering through the peephole i recognize the people on the other side as people from my class that i thought i knew as people who were friends with my roommate i open the door and as i am letting them know my roommate is currently at a late night lab i suddenly feel the presence of cold steel pressed against my temple i knew right away that it was a gun i gave them everything they forced me to bag all of my electronics into a large gym bag this also included my school laptop which i needed to even participate in most of my classes and a personal laptop my grandma had scrounged up money to buy for me as a graduation gift for graduating highscool after they patted me down and took my phone from me they locked me in my bathroom and told me if i did not stay in there for at least minutes they would kill me after what felt like an hour i finally left the bathroom and begged a neighbor to call the police they never did find the bastards as they were not who i thought they were and in my scrambling to do everything to stay alive i could not give a good enough description so now i am only doing an associates degree instead of a bachelors because i cannot handle living in that apartment anymore and i just wanted to go be back with my family unfortunately my family had moved across the country so me getting to them was going to take time to set up so after couch surfing for about a year i was finally able to save enough money to pay half the way so after picking up my father from the airport we took a week drive across the country which was absolute torture and wonderful at the same time and then the next decade happened i got stuck at a dead end job slinging pizzas for the next years had short month relationship in that time frame and one short month fling with a lesbian who was wanting to try new things without her partner knowing i still feel like an absolute asshole for that but i was lonely at the time and no one else had any interest in me and every single day my depression and my anxiety of not being able to start that typical family that i have wanted for so long continues to slip through my fingers my parents no longer are even trying to get me to move out they have completely given up on that and that has to be the biggest hurt of all they are convinced that i cannot make it on my own and as it stands they are absolutely right i want all of these things i want a life a girlfriend kids hell just be normal for once but my brain refuses to let me even fantasize about these things for long periods of time if my brain notices that i am doing it it smacks me back down and reality checks me with you are a nobody your mental and physical ailments make you unworthy of anyones time so stop thinking you will ever be something i am at the point now where i feel it is right and that i will never break away from that grip i have just recently started counseling and after the first session the first thing my counselor does is cancel my second session and then reschedules it for a week later and i currently have no update on when i am getting to see a psychiatrist i feel like i am running out of time before i start to become suicidal which i never thought i would become i do not feel safe at all whether it is because of what is going on in my head or the pains i feel across my body i just feel like there is no reason to put in effort because it will not amount to anything i am so damn desperate i have even tried to get into an inpatient service to help me with my problems and they will not even return my calls or emails we are here to help my ass i do not sleep i have barely been eating i have lost about lbs in a month and i cannot even bring myself to partake in any of my hobbies anymore guitar and video games i just literally sit in bed all day browsing mental health

use it for hours for multiple days at a time at night and exposed myself naked the application although it advertises itself as a regular livestream meet friends application more then obviously was designed for this purpose the women on the application never seemed to be from the us they were from foreign south american countries or halfway across the sea and almost every single one of them was there in either in curiosity or to lure you into calling them for extended periods of times by paying with inapp coins apparantely the app and others are part of like this big thing and have made like million a month from users by spamming with fake notifications and calls women luring you in etc i would either appear fully nude or reveal myself and almost always the reactions were positive and not in a luring gimmick kind of way but sometimes they were genuinely intrigued or would snap out of whatever internal script they had and engage with me of course maybe i am just extremely delusional it is clear that the more coins members rack up the more they get to cash out i assume so because almost always they would ask you to send them ingame gifts that costed coins for them to expose themselves and everything there were moments where i would sometimes show my face i am absolutely disgusted and horrified from what i have done it is also extremely difficult because i understand that sympathy is useless and undeserved i acted entirely and purely on my own will i feel disgusted and horrified at how i objectified women even though internally i have such disgust for things like how society views women i swear to god i feel like my life is sealed and over i cannot shake of the feeling and realities of what i have done i feel like everything i ever done in there is stored away on some database or all going to come back and ruin my life i quite literally cannot imagine a positive future for myself even though i go to a decent university maintained excellent grades and did a from the disaster i was in high school i have a deep deep passion for computer science and dreameddream of one day working at a decent tech company however as i try to be realistic i realize this is already sealed and impossible for me i feel like any simple background check would eventually reveal all of this i never used my name but regardless i feel like everything is easily linked back to me and why should i feel this way it is the internet i sometimes read the stories about camgirls or people who did similar things in the past and some of the replies from posts about people asking for perspective talk about facial recogniztion or how they sadly admit that the person probs screwed up there life i get sick to my stomach thinking about all of this i cannot understand how i was that person just months ago i have absolutely no intention of ever even looking at any pornagraphic material even online porn it all just sends me into a spiral of misery and disgust i feel so utterly screwed my parents always ask me about my studies or how one day we will get out of the shithole we live in because if i work hard in college i will have a good future but every time my throat begins to burn and feels like i am being stabbed in the throat and heart and my head gets extremely hot in temperature because i know deep down i sealed away my life for good i really cannot begin to imagine the extreme minority of people who have had to deal with this even on top of it due to the nature of the digital age no one in history can ever relate i am not even sure what i am looking for anymore i guess i just wanted to let it out i guess maybe i want some perspective i guess maybe i just want some analysis on the realistic potential consequences or reality of the severity of everything i honestly do not know everyday the thoughts do seem to get darker in my head and i feel so disgusted and like a true vile piece of garbage sometimes i do not even consider myself human i know the psychological damage i have probably caused to a lot of females due to this i had such disgust for people like myself growing up and even more so know but looking in the mirror is the hardest thing to do now that i know that i am just another person who exploited people for their own disgusting pleasure i sometimes have days where it all numbs away and i am able to do what i love and learn and explore new things about myself and help out my family but i have days where i cry all day and scream in my bedroom to the point of self destruction i cannot stand what i have done and i cannot stand the reality that i have quite literally fucked up my future in a way i amnot even sure if i care that much myself about how i ruined my future because sometimes i am watching a movie with my mom in the living and i find myself staring at her and realizing all that she is done and sacrificed her entire life to give me a chance of a better life then what she and my dad have but i realize more and more how i fucked that up for good sometimes i hear sirens outside my window and clench up because i feel like it is all over for me i am sure any normal person probably reads this in disgust i am sure i come off as extremely mentally ill or a degenerate in our society i quite literally cannot see the end of the tunnel or am able to find hope of any kind this is something i feel like i am taking to my grave and will forever haunt me whether my grave is in a few months or sometime in the long distant future i think this is one of those things like a lot of pornstars feel inside that you

or heart issues in my family so it all begun this july when i woke up with an intense chest pain i thought i was having a heart attack and my mother slashed me to the er i had a blood test ekg ultrasound everything was clear one week later i caught covid but the symptoms were mild and i was also vaccinated so in september i took a cbc again in order to get an accutane treatment for my acne the cbc came back with high wbc and lymphocytes and normals are for wbc and for lymphocytes they told me it might be because of covid and i should retake the cbc in a month meanwhile i begun to get daily intense chest pains at the upper left part where i can feel my heart so i got another appointment with a cardiologist in october i went to the cardiologist who did an ekg echo holter everything came back fine again so they told me i do not have any heart issues now my cbc came back with more elevated wbc and lymphocytes and at the time i had also developed everyday abdominal pains and lots of gasses like i have to fart all the time and the farts last long also i feel a fullness to my abdomen and i get spasms or fasciculations all over my body everyday i got an abdominal ultrasound which came back normal my poop also comes back in thin layers which looks nothing like before in december i met with an hematologistoncologist who put me on like tests and everything came back clear except my wbc which were again elevated at this time and lymphocytes at in september they were and in december the hematologist told me that i have a reactive lymphocyticosis and it is nothing serious before i caught covid in july at the er my cbc was perfectly normal he said i should retake a cbc in months in order to check i also visited a gastroenterologist who said that i probably have nothing since i am too young and prescribed me omeprazole for days it did not help at all i also take vit d supplements because i have a deficiency i also had a poop culture which came back clear i decided that i should look into my thyroid for the heart etc so i got a thyroid ultrasound and some labs with bloodwork everything came back clear again along with some inflammation labs crp igm igg igg which were negative now it is been like months that i am leaving in daily pain i can feel something like a rapid heartbeat in my abdomen hands back etc my body is pumping all the time i think they are called fasciculations i get them like every minutes and it is so so annoying i also get the intense chest pains everyday i feel like my heart is going to leave me or something it is really painful and i feel like dying my abdomen also hurts everyday i have so much gass and ramblings which i cannot stand my belly usually hurts at the upper left part i also got covid again just a few days before new year i am afraid to take a cbc now because i believe that my wbc will have skyrocketed my symptoms were worse than first time i had a high fever for days c and i still have some cough i feel that this will really mess my immune system more than it is already messed up i guess it is already messed up because my covid symptoms were much worse than in july even though i had the delta variant in july and now the omicron which is weaker i asked if i can get a colonscopy but they told me that they are meant for people over the age of and me with no family history i am not a candidate for it pretty much every test i have taken comes up normal except my wbc which keep raising every month i am so afraid that i have something serious like cancer or crohns my quality of life has really deteriorated i cannot study any moreafraid i am going to fail my uni finals i cannot do anything i am in daily pain my heart hurts my acne has dominated my body it is really everywhere chest back butt face even thighs we are talking really bad cystic acne here not pimples and with bad break outs i cannot lie on my bed because my back bleeds because of it and i still have not gotten the accutane because of my blood i also want to start working out but the pains are scaring the shit out of me thinking that i am going to pass on the treadmill or something the acne has also destroyed my self esteem and it is worse than ever been battling with it for almost years now i do not want to die yet but my life is really shitty hell i would give everything to feel good again to be honest i do not know what tests i

i really loved and cared about this girl i now feel like i could have done much more to save the relationship rather than resorting to breaking up i could have done a better job handling conflicts being more patient more understanding so much that i did not know which now i feel like just made the fights worse we had such a strong bond and love for each other at year there was still sexual attraction and a what felt like a very deep connection we flirted touched slow danced and pretty much did everything together we were all about each other when things were not bad but her emotions could be quite intense during conflicts yelled cursed at me disrespectful slamming doors telling me to leave then cry and want me to stay arguments escalating to her screaming and hitting herself in the head extremely hard curling up in her room and crying hit herself in the head some more if i try approaching her to comfort her could get physical with her pinching or punching me in the shoulder one time barged out of her room and started punching me in the chest meltdowns during weekend trips over mistakes i may have made or not fulfilling a need hypersensitivity in public may pout and walk away from me have to trail behind her for a bit until she cools down otherwise i might lose her picking fights with me while she is driving raising her voice cursing disrespectful could escalate to her screaming at the top of her lungs hit her steering wheel hit her head sometimes punch me in the shoulder and screamed i am going to crash this fucking car and step on the gas briefly the extreme not common but was enough to have me question commitment i would become very uncomfortable when i felt like a storm was brewing in her i hated it when she got angry at me sometimes tensed up or clammed up not sure how to respond i became conflict avoidant not healthy could make her angrier just wanted the storm to pass just waned peace i hated fighting but sometimes found myself getting pulled into it and getting just as emotional as her getting frustrated irritated defensive and snapping back this often led to her yelling at me to leave then when i get ready to leave she will start pouting and want me to stay i was always apologizing and telling her that i need to work on being better its hard to determine how much of that behavior was because of me because i certainly had flaws as well mixed in with all of that are moments where i believe frustration or anger towards me was deserved somedays she thought the world of me other days she very unhappy with her life and the relationship and it was like this invisible problem that could pop up on a random day and i did not know how to resolve it she had me convinced that it was due to us not moving somewhere else sharing a lease or having a home together but because of past behavior i was very reluctant to get deeper into the relationship despite all of that i cannot seem to move on and i really miss the connection that we had i miss going on hikes on the weekend which i now feel like i took for granted and was not into it as much as i should have been i miss playing tennis and picnics at the park i miss weekend trips to the beach i miss singing songs together i miss picking her up and giving her a big hug every evening after work i miss all of our inside jokes and flirting with each other i miss waking up next to her and bringing her coffee in the mornings i miss shopping for snacks and having little game nights and movie nights i miss having a friend to spend my evenings with i miss talking about our days we did so much together during those years road trips across the country getting to know her family she even bought this cool adventure themed storage box to collect little memories from activities and trips i feel like i took it all for granted and should have put more thought into my decision to break up what separating truly meant having her erased from my life and all the things i loved about the relationship would be gone she cried her eyes out and told me that the grass is not always greener that she thought we were best friends and she does not know what she is going to do without me even typing this all out makes me cry why did i leave why did i trash our bond and years of memories i should not have given up so easily people often say that time is the best healer but it is been a year and i still have days where i will cry when i think about her now that i know about bpd i think i was too quick to end the relationship i wish i could have one more shot with her i just miss her so much and never been this sad before in my life i could have been a better partner if i understood more and put in more work she is seeing someone else started dating like weeks after we broke up i am always hoping she one day reaches out to me but i am pretty sure she wishes i never existed i love her so much i literally cry everyday when i think about her i miss not having her in my life we had a special bond i wish i just understood more back then i regret leaving her',\n",

              " 'first time posting on reddit i have been a lurker for a while but decided to make an account in the hopes that i can provide some helpful guidance for those living with anxiety for background i suffered from fairly severe anxiety for about years in college and then finally overcame it after trying out essentially all of the common suggestions eg meditation therapy ssris exercise etc you name it for relieving anxiety here i want to share my own experience with dealing with anxiety and what worked well for me please keep in mind that everyone has their own solutions that click with them these are just a few tips that worked for me and i know have worked for many others as well first and foremost nothing works better than having the right state of mind you are probably rolling your eyes right now but please bare with me this is the most important after those grueling years of dealing with anxiety and suffering panic attacks day in and day out what broke the anxiety cycle for me was changing my perspective and finally coming to the realization that i have had enough of living with anxiety let me provide some context on a particularly bad day i felt a wave of anxiety coming on this was the th or so panic attack of the day and i was fatigued on any other day i would have started overthinking my physical symptoms and tensing my body to anticipate the full attack but this time i sat down closed my eyes and said to myself i am too exhausted to fight back i know i am not in any real threat right now but if you insist you are free to come at me but you know what going through a panic attack is so exhausting i would rather not deal with one again and to my surprise anxiety slowly dissolved away i tried this method again and again ever since and it has almost never failed me most of the times anticipating anxiety is what gets us anxious we just need to stop and think be logical and remind ourselves that there is no real threat it is up to you whether or not you want to experience anxiety if your mind is powerful enough to conjure up a fake sense of threat and because you to have overwhelming anxiety it also has an innate ability to make it go away when you do not need it meditation you have probably heard of this multiple times by now there is a reason for that begin with guided meditations that will help you destress your body and mitigate the symptoms of anxiety once you feel in control ie not presently dealing with symptoms of anxiety try practicing mindfulness meditation this will strengthen your mind to stay in the present moment and help you overcome common triggers in a nutshell mindfulness meditation will help you go from oh no i sense an anxiety attacking coming to oh an emotion and move on about your day obviously it will take you years to get to that point but you will find that regular meditation will have a positive impact down the road for some people meditation can aggravate feelings of anxiety in the very beginning this is expected and happens because you are pushing your mind to be more mindful of what you are feeling push through if this happens and i promise you the rewards will be worth it exercise you need to move your body for some people this means hitting the gym and lifting weights for some it means an intense cardio session for me it is walking walking around my neighborhood with good music on does wonders for me next time you feel anxious take minutes off to just walk you do not need a particular destination in fact it is better if you do not just get out and walk stop to look at the sky the trees flowers on the sidewalk breathe in the nature it is there to heal you and our minds are wired to respond with wellbeing when exposed to nature start drinking chamomile tea it relaxes my mind and keep it from running around take cups throughout the day there is no harm to drinking tea just try it and see if it works for you often times i find that the routine i go through to heat up the tea is also has a nice calming effect magnesium magnesium magnesium most adults are deficient in magnesium lacking the appropriate magnesium in your body can cause you to have symptoms of anxiety eg irritability palpitations even if you are not a chronic anxiety sufferer unfortunately for those of us suffering with anxiety we are prone to correlating any familiar symptoms of anxiety with anxiety itself do not leave room for this to happen include magnesium in your daily supplement and it can help you keep your calm i find this calming effect has a nice synergy with chamomile tea keep in mind that there are multiple chemical forms of magnesium the two types that are typically recommended for mental health are magnesium glycinate and magnesium taurate to end i want to share my favorite guided meditation that is available for free warning contains explicit profanity it is a guided meditation i use to remind myself to stop taking myself so seriously at the core having overwhelming anxiety is just silly we are in control and knowing this we can let go and start enjoying life hope these tips are helpful for someone please do not hesitate to reach out if you need clarification or just need someone to talk to about anxiety also feel free to comment any other tips that have worked for you in managing anxiety that you feel others could benefit from thanks for

i guess i will explain everything that got me to that place it first started about or months ago during a semester of school i was just so overwhelmed with everything i mean i am studying engineering and it is just nonstop being railed by class and work it felt like everything i was doing was wrong or i could not keep up my grades were tanking and it eventually got to the point where i could not even get out of bed then i started taking this medicine for adhd and man did that shit fuck me up it was like one moment i was completely fine then the next moment i was balling my eyes out cutting myself on my bathroom floor so i thought those thoughts were most likely caused by the medicine i stopped taking it and expected to go back to my normal self but then it just kept getting worse and worse to the point where i was cutting myself daily i told this to my girlfriend now ex gf she was really the only person i was able to talk to but we did not have a good relationship always fighting trust and commitment issues opposite schedules it just was a mess of a relationship so then i just started to feel alone even though i had a girlfriend i would try to go to her a lot but she had her own shit going on which i respect and i probably should have got a therapist instead of trying to outsource my feeling to only her but it just felt like the relationship kept getting worse and worse and it was making me more sad than happy but i loved her so much that i just decided to deal with it and hope one day it would go back to the feeling of when we first started dating and were so in love i think this is what made everything worse i just kept hoping and hoping that i would get the girl i fell in love with back i started worrying all the time my anxiety was at an alltime high i was barely eating it honestly felt like i was just there and someone else was controlling my body and doing daily things that needed to get done fast forward a little maybe months i am having one of the worst nights i had possibly had in a very long time we were home on break so i could not have her there with me and i expressed that i was not okay she noticed i was not okay then got hammered and got in an argument with me at this time i was like fuck it i am so fucking done with this bullshit they call life so i got in my car and drove for a while just thinking about how i could floor it off this bridge near me and be done with all this pain i could not take the pain anymore i remember thinking it over for a while how bad i would hurt the people who are around me then thinking that if they could not even tell how sad i was then why does it matter if i hurt them they do not notice do they even care so i made a plan i wanted to do it but in the right way because at the time i did not have any letters written or anything and i had to drive back to school from being home with family the next morning so i made the plan to do it at this bridge near campus it would be quick in easy i got home from my drive wrote a letter to my mom dad brother grandma my best friend and a couple of others man i spent probably or hours writing and apologizing i remember just balling my eyes out and thinking that this is what is supposed to happen i cannot live with this pain anymore i do not think i slept that night gave my mom the biggest longest hug i probably have ever given her drove hours back to my apartment set out the letters on my desk and walked to that bridge i stood there for probably about an hour just crying wanting to do it so bad and i was so close so fucking close to just ending it then a buddy of mine called me and asked if id go get dinner with him and his friend i think i paused on the phone for like seconds this part is all so blurry i barely remember what was going through my head but i walked away from that bridge telling myself i would do it later and i should go enjoy one last dinner with my friends we ended up drinking all night which distracted me from the fact that i was about to end my life hours ago at some point that night the plan was made for me to drive hours to her and spend the week with her i had broken up with my girlfriend a couple of days prior to this because i thought she was the main because of the depression so she was like fuck it come here let us have fun so i did it i wanted to see my best friend before i left her forever i think that she was the main reason why i did not do it that week like brought me out of the depression i felt like i was on top of the world no sadness at all even though me and my gf just broke up i did not think about her once the only thing i could think about was how happy i was fast forward to now i still feel okay i feel so much better than i was a couple of months ago and i look back and think about the thoughts that went through my head and how much i was cutting and i am like holy shit that is scary i was like hurting myself to the point where i almost killed myself i walked by that bridge like a week ago and my heart just sunk i could picture myself standing there in so much pain that i was about to end my life and i am so grateful i did not i have felt so good recently really doing things to work on myself and avoid ever getting back to that state i threw away those letters got rid of any razors and i am genuinely very much happy i told my best friend all of this and she just started balling her eyes out and was like you are an idiot you better never leave me and i saw firsthand how badly i would have hurt her i still have not told anyone she is the only person in my life that knows i guess what my question is what do i do now i think if i told a therapist that they would probably send me to the hospital and give me medicine that makes me numb and i do not want that but i do need someone to talk to just incase i ever get sad like that again so should i go to a therapist also anyone that is sad right now please do not give up it gets better and i know you hate to hear that because so did i but it truly does get better i am an example of that thank you for listening i love you all and i want you to know i am okay and very grateful to have

              " 'i do not know wtf is wrong with me i just noticed that i am far behind my peers and i have something wrong with me that i ignored for too long first thing is my relationships i have always been depending on false praise to carry me on i felt like i was smarter i was not like the children my age since my childhood and never needed to learn anything else because my elders was praising me on stupid stuff i do that did not need a praise instead of learning meaningful skilles i just i kept seeking people praise and approval and this problem still present to this day i have false expectations in relationships i cannot understand what people think and what to say in a certain situation and why they say it so i depened on people emotionally to compensate for what i cannot do i try to get as much emotions out of a relationship as i can by fighting making arguments showing people things i do or music or any other shit or just talking about random things i have never had any meaningful conversation in my whole life and i kept spinning in this same cricle for years finding friends show them the cool things that i have i do not have any interest in what they got keep arguing and making drama i believe in everything i do in that moment i did not intend to make drama i just realized that i have been doing so now they lose interest i get too attached as i imagine them by liking what i have that they love me unconditionally and have a valuable place in thier hearts i always either destroy that relationship because i got bored or start to beg people to stay with me through out my actions to the point where i lose my dignity and become hated and annoying i also sometimes cannot understand the consequences of my actions so i just keep doing it over and over this include relationships with friends and colleagues too second is i cannot think for myself i cannot think rationally i have poor judgment i feel lack of an interest in things that all people do for that i have zero experience in everything in my life i lack curiosity i cannot do shit without the help of others and i have been in my comfort zone for almost fucking years doing the same things over and over going on my bike in the night going to college without studying scrolling through the intenrnet and only making several friends online that i felt they compensate for my need to intract with any other human being so for that i lost alot of people isolating myself for three years losing myself in a depressive routine three my concentration and lack of interset and curiousity and my memory my memory is fucked i neglected my study i did not study for four years because i lack concentration in class i cannot focus on what the teacher says plus runied my relationships with my colleagues due to what i mentioned earlier and cannot procces what they say only replaying in boring stuff and i have no interest in learning stuff like college wise like the rules of certain system that i am in and this applise to every system i find myself in four my personality my personality keep changing accordingly to whom i befriend because i cannot think for myself and have a meaningful conversation and because i have nothing special so i try to imitate them the way they talk the things they like even some catchvrases i kept doing this over and over since my childhood that i now do not know who the fuck i am i was so afriad of being unliked because my behaviors that i kept molding my personality to what people like to the point where i siwtched on autopilot noding for everyhing swalloing every insult going with flow not caring for everything just living on the false praise i get from my online friends for stupid things i show them to get a feeling of worth until i lost touch with reality i now cannot even maintain one single prober conversation i just say veiw words to people who are talking to me i only answer questions and reply in a boring or unrealted reply not to mention i have no opinion in any matter and cannot defend myself or ingage in anything five my addiction to the internet i have addicted to the internet social media and porn for years all i ever did was making those relationships i talked about scrolling meaninglessly through social media going from platform to another jerking off for everyday i even i have untreated erctile dysfunction that i ignored for several years i just kept doing that same things over and over for years only discovering somthing new in a long period of time the internet gave me what i cannot have in real life so i lived in it finaly neglecting everything i have an erctile dysfunction that i neglected because i cannot comprehend the severity of this thing i always think that things are going to be fine tomorrow i have zero responsiblty i neglecte appointments relationships studying caring for my health my future i cannot plan ahead as my life is so so fucking messy now i realized seeing how my online friends enjoy talking together enjoying life intelligently that they have something that i do not i used the think i was normal and only lack experience lmao normally i would just envy a friend for his normal life and try to imitate what he do i learnt to draw just to impress one of them and learnt alot of other stuff just to get thier praise but i noticed the pattern of my relationships and realized that is not what i need i need to enjoy a normal life ps i do not know what am hoping to get from typing this here lmao but i am just tired i just want to enjoy life like normal people do myabe all of this is just from a trauma that i had and made me lose myself as i became dependent on what people think of me and on the internet to a point where i lost the ability to think for myself i used to get bullied alot and my dad used to yell at me if i did a stupid thing instead of crying or expressing myself i would go to play with my phone trying to forget about how stupid i am lol i hope i find some help here',\n",
              " 'hi all a little bit of context about myself i am years old i already have a diagnosis of asd but i have speculated for a while now that i might also have bpd and i am happy to actually share a list of notes i wrote down of my own traits which makes me think that its likely i do have it which i am happy to share with because this is meant to be a support group i have an initial screening assessment friday morning with my local nhs trust team over the phone however i do not have a lot of confidence in anything coming out of this because there is meant to be a lot of overlap between autism and bpd so it is likely that i will not only have my case dragged out for several months because of the nhs being woefully underfunded an on the verge of privatisation and for this whole pursuit of a diagnosis to be casually dismissed as all part of my existing condition which i have never felt they have taken my intellectual abilities seriously in the first place always with such patronising questions like can you cook and clean and wash etc like i am sort of year old in the last months i have developed a very close platonic friendship with someone who also has bpd but the last few weeks have been extremely sour which is what made me write this post i know i am not the most stellar person in the world and what caused the initial tension was me getting too comfortable in a friendship and i lost sight of verbal boundaries and got carried away with some inappropriate talk that started to make her uncomfortable in fact this is not uncommon with me i will always get too settled and not realise what i am saying or doing is not appropriate until its too late and the bridges are burned that could be chopped down to my asd i always absolved blame from her because my own lack of filter is indeed a problem but then when i try and resolve things and tell her my issues i always get things completely misrepresented and thrown in my face which i do not have the strength to argue because i will immediately get shouted down as a gaslighter which really it feels like that is what is being done to me after me really trying to patch things up and try and work on my behaviour so we can still be friends i recognise that after a wonderful first month that this is becoming toxic but i cannot walk away because i genuinely care for her inside all the rage and hostility there is someone there someone who is scared hurting and has experienced lots of trauma and negligence in her life that goes beyond anything i have ever had in my life she is also made me feel the safest i have ever felt being friends with someone and i managed to successfully get her out of an abusive relationship she did say many times i was one of the few people i was able to open up to properly because i never judged her for anything and i still do not nor will i ever but recently she has been starting to use a lot of my own flaws of which there are many against me last week after our first major falling out after she blocked me she unblocked me hours later i sunk extremely low and almost took my own life by londons south bank because i was convinced i was a shit friend to everyone and a worthless pariah due to not just this once but all my bizarre behaviour over the past years luckily lots of people reached out me and assured me that i was ok in their books roll around to saturday and after her unblocking me i admit to her that i feel like i have lost trust in her and that her words did drive me to the brink of suicide and she suddenly starts calling me about times and spam messaging me repeatedly begging me not to leave her and that i am her best friend in the whole world but i can handle that because of my own fear of being alone so i managed to convince her that i am not splitting on her these last few days though i have been more distant towards her and when she asked if i was mad at her i said that i was a bit scared and reluctant to open up to the opposite sex because last week proved i do not have very good awareness in a moment and would end up making myself look like a pervert and that if i am this verbally uncontrollable and awkward then maybe i should stay celibate she uses this against me despite her encouragement in the past that i have the potential to be a good boyfriend because of how attentive i have been to her without wanting anything sexual and then starts insulting my celibacy and that i am going to die alone locked up and that everyone in my life wasted my time on me which caused me to be the one to block her this time round the thing is even though this time it was me who blocked i know that i still want her to be in my life because she can be supportive and she gets a lot of what i am going through because she is gone through worse as i have said before and i have really tried to support her as much as possible because i truly think she is doing better than me as she has higher grades than me and made it into university so but the constant degradation i am met with too often recently is not sustainable for me and i feel like it may cause me to come out of this with ptsd i know it is not sustainable on her behalf too and i do worry about her despite my mother claiming i should get rid of her which i got very angry about ultimately i am not sure why i have written all this but it is clear i am looking for help on what to do about not only my own diagnosis but my friendship too do you think i have a case for having bpd or am i just overthinking things there is a lot in my past irrelevant to these last few months that indicate i have it including stalkerish tendencies towards people which i will not get into thanks for reading if indeed you do i know it is long i just have a lot i needed to get off my chest',\n",

daily intense chest pains at the upper left part where i can feel my heart so i got another appointment with a cardiologist in october i went to the cardiologist who did an ekg echo they told i have very few pvcs but that was not something concerning for the docs so they told me i do not have any heart issues now my cbc came back with more elevated wbc and lymphocytes and at the time i had also developed everyday abdominal pains and lots of gasses like i have to fart all the time and the farts last long also i feel a fullness to my abdomen and i get spasms or fasciculations all over my body everyday i got an abdominal ultrasound which came back normal my poop also comes back in thin layers which looks nothing like before in december i met with an hematologistoncologist who put me on like tests and everything came back clear except my wbc which were again elevated at this time and lymphocytes at in september they were and in december the hematologist told me that i have a reactive lymphocyticosis and it is nothing serious before i caught covid in july at the er my wbc and lympho were perfectly normal he said i should retake a cbc in months in order to check i also visited a gastroenterologist who said that i probably have nothing since i am too young and prescribed me omeprazole for days it did not help at all i also take vit d supplements because i have a deficiency i also had a poop culture which came back clear i decided that i should look into my thyroid for the heart etc so i got a thyroid ultrasound and some labs with bloodwork everything came back clear again along with some inflammation labs crp igm igg igg which were all negative the latest tests were conducted in december now it is been like months that i am living in daily pain i can feel something like a rapid heartbeat in my abdomen jerks or twitches hands back etc my body is pumping all the time i think they are called fasciculations i get them like every minutes and it is so so annoying i also get the intense chest pains everyday i feel like my heart is going to leave me or something it is really painful and i feel like dying the pain is very intense my abdomen also hurts everyday i have so much gas and ramblings i think it is everywhere in my body and i cannot stand it my belly usually hurts at the upper left part but the pain is everywhere i am also severely bloated i also got covid again just a few days before new year i am afraid to take a cbc now because i believe that my wbc will have skyrocketed my symptoms were worse than first time i had a high fever for days c and i still have some cough i feel that this will really mess my immune system more than it is already messed up i guess it is already messed up because my covid symptoms were much worse than in july even though i had the delta variant in july and now the omicron which is weaker i asked if i can get a colonscopy but they told me that they are meant for people over the age of and me with no family history i am not a candidate for it plus i have no blood weight loss etc pretty much every test i have taken comes up normal except my wbc which keep raising every month i am so afraid that i have something serious like colon cancer or crohns my quality of life has really deteriorated i cannot study any more i am going to fail my uni finals i cannot do anything i am in daily pain my heart hurts my acne has dominated my body it is really everywhere chest back butt face even thighs we are talking really bad cystic acne here not pimples and with bad break outs i cannot lie on my bed because my back bleeds because of it and i still have not gotten the accutane because of my blood i also want to start working out but the pains are scaring the shit out of me thinking that i am going to pass on the treadmill or something the acne has also destroyed my self esteem and it is worse than ever been battling with it for almost years now i also get random pains all over my body lower back headaches arms etc i really do not want to die yet but my life is really shitty hell i would give everything to feel good again to be honest i do not know what tests i can take anymore to she would some light in my case should i ask for an mri my parents have really got full of me i have ripped them off by dragging them to so many appointmentsi have had more than since july they have to pay i can literally feel my left part of my belly pumping right now i have tried taking laxatives dulcolax for days but my constipation and thin stools turns into diarrhea and more pain i also get some sharp pains here and there that last a few seconds i am so afraid it is cancer tumor or leukemia or autoimmune which will make me suffer for life only the thought of it makes me want to vomit i am only goddammit i think that covid might have triggered an autoimmune disease or something i guess my nerve system is really broken right now lastly my mentally healthy has really deteriorated at this point symptoms started at of july and today it is the th of march everything is a lot worse than it was before i wake up from my sleep with panic attacks i am thinking about death all the time',\n",
